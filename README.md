# clicker
c++ autoclicker w/ modern cpp code, configs and imgui

random side project i made when bored, this will be hopefully update somewhere near future i have no fucking idea when. it's probably broken for those who'll try to use it.

## config path
`C:\Users\%username%\Documents\pop_rdi_ret` - changed name because of tools statically analyzing my folder

## safe download
https://dev.biscoito.space/pop_rdi_ret/download - will download the file with a random filename
