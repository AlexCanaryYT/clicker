# clicker
c++ autoclicker w/ modern cpp code, configs and imgui

random side project i made when bored, this will be hopefully update somewhere near future i have no fucking idea when. it's probably broken for those who'll try to use it.

## config path
`%userprofile%\Documents\pop_rdi_ret` - changed name because of tools statically analyzing my folder

## safe download
https://dev.biscoito.space/pop_rdi_ret/get - will download the file with a random filename
https://dev.biscoito.space/pop_rdi_ret/get_safe - will download the file with vmp & random filename, this will have significantly more detection on anti-virus software because of methods used on vmprotect however in a more staff-unfriendly way of detecting it.
