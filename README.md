# clicker
c++ autoclicker w/ modern cpp code, configs and imgui

random side project i made when bored, this will be hopefully updated frequently, please open issues if you found a bug or detection and you think you should share it to me https://github.com/b1scoito/clicker/issues

## menu

## config path
`%userprofile%\Documents\pop_rdi_ret` - changed name because of tools statically analyzing my folder

## download
https://dev.biscoito.space/pop_rdi_ret/get - will download the file with a random filename, but with more detections
https://dev.biscoito.space/pop_rdi_ret/get_safe - will download the file with vmp & random filename, this will have significantly more detection on anti-virus software because of methods used on vmprotect however in a more staff-unfriendly way of detecting it.
